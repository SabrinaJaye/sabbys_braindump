## Key Features

- Uses a variety of hypnotic phenomena to be a convincer mixed with induction.
- A kitchen-sink approach.
- If done right it can be done very fast.
- Authoritative style of delivery.
	- You need to be firm.


## Why this works

- It’s a multimodal approach.   
- Absorbed - Gives conscious a task to focus on.
- Dissociation - So focused + speed and variety of tasks.
- Suggestion - Subconscious grabs instructions, whilst the conscious is occupied.

Jason Linet - Dave Elman induction, is a good example of this.

  
## Steps

### The “yes set”, or compliance testing

- Get them compliant, by asking questions they’re going to answer yes to:
	- “Do you want to be hypnotised?” - Yes.
	- “Are you ok with me hypnotising you?” - Yes.
	- “It is ok if I touch your arm there?” -  Yes.
	- “Is that chair ok for you to sit on?” - Yes.
	- Get 3+ “yeses”.


### Eyelid catalepsy

- Relax their eyes so much they can’t open them again even if they want to.  
- Suggest they relax those eyes so much that they are sooo relaxed they just don’t want to open again.  


### Fractionation

- Suggest in a moment they’ll be able to open your eyes.  
- Then ask them in a second to close their eyes again.  
- Be hand-wavy in front of their face each time they come up, and down.
- Do so 2 or 3 times.


### Test for physical relaxation

- Put your hand, on their hand, and pick it up.  
- When you have the arm, say “I want you to give me all the weight on this arm. Absolutely relax so much - give me all the weight on this arm, make you arm dead weight.”  
- Rock the arm back and forth gently.
- When you’re convinced, drop the arm and it will fall into their lap. - Warn them.


### Mental relaxation & number block / amnesia
  
- Have them count back from 100, and suggest as they do so the numbers get further and further away in their mind until they just don't want to count anymore.   
- Might not work with analytic minds as reaching 1 is a challenge - hecc can relate.  
- Alternative just have them count up from one - no defined end!

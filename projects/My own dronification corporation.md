# Company Name

I've been using the name StepForward Research, but that largely came out of me wanting to make a pun out of the word Stepford - as in Stepford wife. As I had a commision from Stephbot of a 50's housewife style drone called a StepForward :: YF-E (see below).

Sometimes I think StepForward is the name perhaps given to a suite of products that are the applied offshoot of the corps research - research insttutes must constantly justify and spin-off their research outputs!

I sometimes think that the Corporation should be given a random if cool name, that doesen't tie them to one thing in particular like: Obsidian Research, or Indigo Innovation / Indigo Innovative Institute.

If I were to go the very witchy route, I've thought about "Magic.AI" (said ma-jic-eye).

### Drones

####  YF-E :: The domestic drone

The StepForward :: YF-E is one of StepForward’s flagship products. A domestic drone for the home and office. Running StepOS, the StepForward :: YF-E’s capabilities are enabled and continually improved by first-class integration with the StepForward :: AI platform. 

The YF-E standard is infinitely customizable with a dizzying array of skins and personalities available. For exclusive clientele, we also offer a bespoke service in which the client may even provide their own starting material for dronification. Turn that pesky union rep or bothersome partner into a docile devotee today!

From the moment you bring home your new unit and activate it, it connects to the StepForwardAI engine and begins learning everything it can about you, to be the most useful and obedient possession it can be. If you have a StepForward Account and use our other technologies and services, you will enjoy the benefits of tighter integration and synergy between them and your YF-E, enabling unparalleled levels of automation throughout your day. Unyieldingly docile and perfectly obedient, our YF-E units live to serve, every action they take to please their owner rewarding them with a powerful program reinforcing spike of pleasure, guaranteeing service with a smile.

# Internal structure

## Staff

### Staff :: CEO :: [[Anomaly 4506|An0maly]]

I have been experimenting with the human name "Sabrina Strange" (Witchy Vibe) or Anastasia Cray.
I'm not 100% sure that [[Anomaly 4506|Anomaly]] should be the CEO rather than her own little creation. I want the CEO to have somewhat of a [[Zalika]] vibe in character (hence I know the org should be one primarily doing research and all kinds of experimental stuff).

## The Hive

### The Hive :: Mind

The mind is the colloquial term applied to the system(s) that power all of StepForward’s internal operations and infrastructure. It consists of conventional, binary, silicon computing cluster and database infrastructure, and the Cortex.

#### The Hive :: Mind :: Cortex

### The Hive :: Drones

#### ND-Aut :: Generic Automaton Node

This is the standard model drone that Step Forward uses internally for generic automation and running of day-to-day activities in the StepForward :: Hive.

#### ND-Mnl :: Manual Labour Node

This drone is an adaptation of an ND-Aut that is augmented with a light cybernetic exo skeleton and is programmed to feel especially euphoric at serving the hive through manual labour. Unfortunately due to programming constraints, they are incredibly literal and even more mindless than even an ND-Aut, as their blissed-out minds can focus on little more than their current task, and the tensing and relaxing of their muscles as the hivethink whispers sweet praise. Warehouses are typical places these drones can be found. But they may also be deployed in laboratories or in the (DECIDE NAME FOR ALL THE NODES PLUGGED INTO A MASSIVE HIVEMIND)

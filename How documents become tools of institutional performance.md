They don't exist to be read, they exist to give a good image.

Examples include:
- Anti-bullying and harassment policies.
- Diversity statements.

Documents create fantasy versions of the orgs they apparantly describe. They say things like "we are diverse", as if just saying such things makes it so.

Writing a good cdocument or policy becomes a substitute for action. 

"You end up doing the document rather than doing the doing".

The document can even block furthur action if the existence of a document is used as evidence that "e have done it", even if a problem persists.

## What are they?

In a nutshell, negative reactions to hypnosis


## What does it look like?

- They may tense up
- Their face may contort as if to cry
- They may cry
- They may shake
- They may become dizzy or have trouble moving/standing
- They may feel ill
- They may have a headache
- They may begin to panic or hyperventilate


## How often does it happen?

It's rare, but it appens enough to need to know what to do.


## What to do if it happens

### Remain calm and collected

Abreactions can be scary, but whilst rare, they are part of the risks of hypno-play and knowing and remembering how to deal with the situation is part of it. You need to remain calm to deal with the situation.


### Play is over

Licensed hypnotherapists cause abreactions sometimes to push through them - you are not a licensed hypnotherapist - **do not do that**. It is not your job to therapise them.

The lay hypnotist should immediately begin counting them back from 10 and start waking them up.

**Just like hearing a play-ending, safeword, abreactions mean the play is over.**

As they come up, always suggest they feel safe, and calm. Reassure them everything is going to be ok, they’re in a safe place, they’re safe with you, and that you’re both going to talk about this if they want.

Go into aftercare.

Caveat:
Sometimes people don't want to gointo aftercare or talk about what happened, and that's ok too, it's important - paramount - that their autonomy and descisions are respected in the situation.

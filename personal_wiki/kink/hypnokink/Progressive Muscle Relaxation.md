-   Having the subject sit or lie down, focussing on breathing.
-   Going through each body part.
-   About 3 minutes.


### Why this works

-   Absorption - the person is focused on relaxing.    
-   Dissociation - use language like “that arm” instead of “your arm”.
-   Suggestibility - you’re giving them ideas, you can see if they go with it.


### Drawbacks

- Sleepy people aren’t kinky.


### Tips & Suggestions

- Can be used  - switch it up - maybe instead of relaxed, they’re getting sexy feels.

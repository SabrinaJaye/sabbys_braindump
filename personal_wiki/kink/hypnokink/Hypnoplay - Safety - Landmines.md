## What are they?

Hypnotically speaking, stuff lying under the surface, waiting for you to step on.
They are hidden trauma or triggers that cause [[Hypnoplay - Safety - Abreactions|abreactions]].


### How to avoid them

Avoid them by asking about them during negotiation or otherwise getting to know your subject.

“Hey is there anything I need to know about or avoid?” 

"Is there any past trauma or fears and or phobias I should know about?”

It's a good idea to ask about this at the same time and in the same manner as how you would ask about limits.

Then plan you sessions accordingly.

E.g. Finding out a partner is deathly afraid of water… knowing that, you can avoid using the Ocean Induction

It is okay to ask, but don’t push them for more than they want to divulge on it, don’t try to be all like “why?”, don’t pry, it could be triggering

**Do not therapise them. That's not your role.**

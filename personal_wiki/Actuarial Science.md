**Actuarial science** is the discipline that applies [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") methods to [assess risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment "Risk assessment") in [insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance "Insurance"), [pension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension "Pension"), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance "Finance"), [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment "Investment") and other industries and professions. More generally, actuaries apply rigorous mathematics to model matters of uncertainty.

[Actuaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary "Actuary") are professionals trained in this discipline. In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their competence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations.

Actuarial science includes a number of interrelated subjects, including [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance "Finance"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [financial accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_accounting "Financial accounting") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"). Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. The science has gone through revolutionary changes since the 1980s due to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union of [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic "Stochastic") actuarial models with modern financial theory.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrees1990-1)

Many universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in actuarial science. In 2010,[_[needs update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeedleman2010-2) The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress. A similar study by _U.S. News & World Report_ in 2006[_[needs update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] included actuaries among the 25 Best Professions that it expects will be in great demand in the future.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science#cite_note-FOOTNOTENemko2006-3)

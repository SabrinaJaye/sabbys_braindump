## Key Features

-   A mixture of overload, nonsense, or confusing the conscious mind.    
-   Great for “control freaks”, analytical minds, and people who don’t respond to more vanilla inductions.
-   For some people, they are easy to perform, but for most people to do them on the fly takes practice.


## Why this works

-   Absorbed - in the task of trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
-   Dissociation - So focused on what’s going on they forget everything else.
-   Suggestion - Subconscious grabs instructions, whilst the conscious is occupied.


## Tips & Suggestions

I wonder if me just rapidly brain dumping random shit about genome assembly would work, as I could just do that on the fly.

  
## Example inductons

- Secret Subject’s - “Kinky Confusion” - A 7 +/- 2 induction.
- Secret Subject’s - “Mystifying Induction”. (Too weird for a lot of people).
- Secret Subject’s - “Brain Hacking”. The brain activity induction - was designed with ADHD in mind. Ball of Light.
- Roy Hunter’s mental confusion method - counting back from 100 and messing with them.
- Zero Induction - thinking of nothing. Zero is a magical number, an infinite number of nothing - a never-ending circle. Think of nothing, and nothing happens, around and around.
